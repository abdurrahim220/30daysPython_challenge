# creating variables

# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(x)
# print(y)


# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

# x = 4 # now it is intiger values 
# x = "rahim" # now it is string type values
# print(x)

# Casting --If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

# x = str(3)
# y = int(3)
# z = float(3)

# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)

# Get the Type -- You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

# x = 5;

# y = "Abdur rahim"

# z = 5.054
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))


# Single or Double Quotes? -- String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

# x = "Md. Abdur Rahim"
# y = 'Md . rafik uddin'

# print(x)
# print(y)

# Case-Sensitive -- Variable names are case-sensitive.

# a = 4
# A = "Sally" 

# a will not overwrite A
