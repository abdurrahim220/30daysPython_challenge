# Python - Output Variables

x = "Python is awsome"

print(x)

# You can print multiple variables separated by a comma;

y = "Rahim"
z = "Nadim"
m = "mehedi"

print(y, z, m)

# You can also + operator to output multiple variables :
print(y + z + m)

# For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:

x = 10
y = 5

print(x + y)

# In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:

x = 5 
y = "rahim"

# print(x + y)

# to overcome this error you have to use commas in the print function

print(x , y)
